# Autoprefix-commit
A simple intellij plugin that puts the current branch name in front of the commit message
* Updates the branch every time the commit dialog is focussed
* Puts #[branchname] in front of any pre-existing text (unless the branch name was already there)
* No config for other fixed characters
* Tested on IntelliJ 2025.x
